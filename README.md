python code for 2048 game we play. Initially we are given with a 4*4 matrix with all the elements zero and a 2 generated at any
random empty(containing 0) cell. After that we can perform following commands: move up, move down, move left, move right. These 
commands will move all the elements of the matrix in a particular direction and combine the equal numbers and make value of extreme
cell double and other cell will have 0. After each command a new 2 is generated at any random cell containing Zero. At the end in 
such a way if we can make 2048 number then we will win the game. Or if at any point all the cells will gets filled and we are left with
no cell containing zero to generate a new 2 then we loss the game.
